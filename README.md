# 😄 Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection

This project is a real-time emotion detection system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial expressions into seven categories using live webcam input. The model is trained using grayscale face images and deployed with a live video feed interface using Streamlit and OpenCV.
